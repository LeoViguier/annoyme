# AnnoyMe

Do you have a long distance girlfriend who's love language is annoying you ?
Do you spend too much time on your computer and not enough caring about her ?
Are you still asking chatGPT for advice on what gift to get her ?

Well, look no further, AnnoyMe is here to help you out. AnnoyMe is a simple python web server that listens for requests, and will do stuff on your computer to annoy you.

This will:
- Moving your mouse around
- Move your windows around
- Opening random applications
- Typing random stuff
- Playing random sounds
- All of them at the same time !

It works by counting the number of requests it receives in 5 seconds, and it runs an action based on that number. The more requests you send, the more annoying it gets. You can configure a cooldown time to prevent it from being too annoying, but don't tell her.
